               <div class="sc_call_to_action_descr sc_item_descr">The Indian Consumer Protection Act was passed in 1986 and it came into force from I July, 1987. The main objectives of the CP Act.-1986 to provide better protection to consumers and effective safeguards against different types of exploitation such marketing of defective GOODS and SERVICES and unfair trade practices, which may be practiced by some manufacturers and traders.<br>
                  The agenda of a consumer forum is to provide relief to both the parties and discourage long litigation. In a process called 'informal adjudication', forum officials mediate between the two parties and urge compromise.<br>
                  The CP Act applies to all goods and services unless specifically exempted by the Union Government and covers all sectors, whether private, public, or cooperative<br>
                  This CP Act has provided a machinery whereby consumers can file their complaints. These complaints will then be heard by consumer forums with special powers so that action can be taken against erring suppliers and possible compensation is awarded to the consumer for the hardships he/she has undergone.<br>
                  Please remember, consumer forum / courts provide redress only in cases of products or services for personal use; defects in products used for commercial purposes are not entertained.
